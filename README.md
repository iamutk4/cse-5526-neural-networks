Programming and homework assignments from class CSE-5526, Spring 2023, OSU

This repository contains 8 folders, consisting of 3 programming assignments and 5 homework assignments. Each programming assignment folder (pa1 - pa3) contains the assignment PDF, code (.ipynb file), and a report. Each homework assignment folder (HW1 - HW5) contains the final report.

Topic of discussion in each folder is given as follows:

1. PA1: Two-layer perceptron with the backpropagation algorithm to solve the parity problem. Effect of 'eta' on convergence, and effect of momentum on speed of training

2. PA2: RBF network for a one-dimensional input variable, one-dimensional output variable, and Gaussian basis functions. Cases of unique cluster variances and same cluster variance implemented separately, and their advantages compared

3. PA3: Train an SVM to determine if a genomic sequence is an ncRNA. Classification done using lnear SVM, and RBF kernel SVM separately

4. HW1

5. HW2

6. HW3

7. HW4

8. HW5
